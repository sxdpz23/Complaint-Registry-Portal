There is only one problem remaining now Shantanu....
The time which is inputted when someone registers as well as last visits his/her own account....
The server uses the time of Austria which is 4 and a half hours earlier than us India time.....
The system uses GMT +1 and India uses GMT +5:30......
So search the problem.....
Problem Maybe in the Controller part of Login or Registration.....
Good Luck and Sweet Dreams.....!!!!
And Don't Forget to wish Alicia for her birthday!!
